    Eclipse Public License - v 2.0<br/>
<br/>
    1. DEFINITIONS<br/>
<br/>
    "Contribution" means:<br/>
<br/>
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content<br/>
    Distributed under this Agreement, and<br/>
<br/>
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br/>
    i) changes to the Program, and<br/>
    ii) additions to the Program;<br/>
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from<br/>
    and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution<br/>
    "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by<br/>
    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.<br/>
    Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that<br/>
    are not Modified Works.<br/>
<br/>
    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.<br/>
<br/>
    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which<br/>
    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone<br/>
    or when combined with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this<br/>
    Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement<br/>
    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.<br/>
<br/>
    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other<br/>
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the<br/>
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br/>
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.<br/>
<br/>
    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that<br/>
    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the<br/>
    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file<br/>
    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified<br/>
    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,<br/>
    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely<br/>
    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program<br/>
    or Modified Works thereof.<br/>
<br/>
    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available<br/>
    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.<br/>
<br/>
    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making<br/>
    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,<br/>
    documentation source, and configuration files.<br/>
<br/>
    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,<br/>
    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any<br/>
    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial<br/>
    Contributor.<br/>
<br/>
    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br/>
<br/>
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby<br/>
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright<br/>
    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,<br/>
    publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such<br/>
    Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.<br/>
<br/>
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby<br/>
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent<br/>
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,<br/>
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,<br/>
    if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall<br/>
    apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at<br/>
    the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition<br/>
    of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the<br/>
    Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other<br/>
    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is<br/>
    licensed hereunder.<br/>
<br/>
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the<br/>
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are<br/>
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the<br/>
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.<br/>
    Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims<br/>
    brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual<br/>
    property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the<br/>
    rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby<br/>
    assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual<br/>
    property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party<br/>
    patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the<br/>
    Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license<br/>
    before distributing the Program.<br/>
<br/>
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has<br/>
    sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant<br/>
    the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
    e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no<br/>
    Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than<br/>
    those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's<br/>
    receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License<br/>
    (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).<br/>
<br/>
    3. REQUIREMENTS<br/>
<br/>
    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:<br/>
<br/>
    a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in<br/>
    accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany<br/>
    the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program<br/>
    is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to<br/>
    obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily<br/>
    used for software exchange; and<br/>
<br/>
    b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license<br/>
    different than this Agreement, provided that such license:<br/>
    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all<br/>
    warranties and conditions, express and implied, including<br/>
    warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and<br/>
    implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness<br/>
    for a particular purpose;<br/>
<br/>
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all<br/>
    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,<br/>
    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br/>
<br/>
    iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights<br/>
    in the Source Code under section 3.2; and<br/>
<br/>
    iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any<br/>
    party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements<br/>
    of this section 3.<br/>
<br/>
    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:<br/>
<br/>
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the<br/>
    Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or<br/>
    files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial<br/>
    Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in<br/>
    Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available<br/>
    under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and<br/>
<br/>
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of<br/>
    the Program.<br/>
<br/>
    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,<br/>
    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations<br/>
    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of<br/>
    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add<br/>
    their own appropriate notices.<br/>
<br/>
    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br/>
<br/>
    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities<br/>
    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this<br/>
    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,<br/>
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product<br/>
    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential<br/>
    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes<br/>
    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor<br/>
    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every<br/>
    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,<br/>
    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits<br/>
    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified<br/>
    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such<br/>
    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program<br/>
    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not<br/>
    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged<br/>
    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified<br/>
    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in<br/>
    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,<br/>
    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any<br/>
    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may<br/>
    participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br/>
<br/>
    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial<br/>
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial<br/>
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance<br/>
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance<br/>
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility<br/>
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to<br/>
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance<br/>
    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to<br/>
    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay<br/>
    those damages.<br/>
<br/>
    5. NO WARRANTY<br/>
<br/>
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT<br/>
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"<br/>
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR<br/>
    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF<br/>
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>
    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the<br/>
    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all<br/>
    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,<br/>
    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,<br/>
    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs<br/>
    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br/>
<br/>
    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
<br/>
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT<br/>
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS<br/>
    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,<br/>
    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST<br/>
    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN<br/>
    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)<br/>
    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE<br/>
    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE<br/>
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
    7. GENERAL<br/>
<br/>
    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under<br/>
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br/>
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further<br/>
    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the<br/>
    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br/>
<br/>
    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity<br/>
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the<br/>
    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software<br/>
    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's<br/>
    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such<br/>
    litigation is filed.<br/>
<br/>
    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it<br/>
    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this<br/>
    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of<br/>
    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's<br/>
    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use<br/>
    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.<br/>
    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses<br/>
    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br/>
<br/>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,<br/>
    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and<br/>
    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward<br/>
    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of<br/>
    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement<br/>
    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation<br/>
    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the<br/>
    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate<br/>
    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing<br/>
    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be<br/>
    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was<br/>
    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,<br/>
    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its<br/>
    Contributions) under the new version.<br/>
<br/>
    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient<br/>
    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any<br/>
    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,<br/>
    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted<br/>
    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended<br/>
    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.<br/>
    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice<br/>
<br/>
    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following<br/>
    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth<br/>
    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),<br/>
    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."<br/>
<br/>
    Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A<br/>
    is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.<br/>
<br/>
    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular<br/>
    file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE<br/>
    file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to<br/>
    look for such a notice.<br/>
<br/>
    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
