    Eclipse Public License - v 1.0<br/>
<br/>
    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC<br/>
    LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM<br/>
    CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br/>
<br/>
    1. DEFINITIONS<br/>
<br/>
    "Contribution" means:<br/>
<br/>
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation<br/>
    distributed under this Agreement, and<br/>
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br/>
    i) changes to the Program, and<br/>
    ii) additions to the Program;<br/>
<br/>
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are<br/>
    distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'<br/>
    from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor<br/>
    itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not<br/>
    include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of<br/>
    software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own<br/>
    license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<br/>
<br/>
    "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br/>
<br/>
    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are<br/>
    necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when<br/>
    combined with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this<br/>
    Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,<br/>
    including all Contributors.<br/>
<br/>
    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br/>
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants<br/>
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to<br/>
    reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly<br/>
    perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,<br/>
    if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br/>
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants<br/>
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under<br/>
    Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise<br/>
    transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and<br/>
    object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of<br/>
    the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is<br/>
    added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such<br/>
    combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license<br/>
    shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.<br/>
    No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br/>
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses<br/>
    to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any<br/>
    Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other<br/>
    intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor<br/>
    disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other<br/>
    entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or<br/>
    otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted<br/>
    hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure<br/>
    any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a<br/>
    third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute<br/>
    the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license<br/>
    before distributing the Program.<br/>
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient<br/>
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright<br/>
    license set forth in this Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
    3. REQUIREMENTS<br/>
<br/>
    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under<br/>
    its own license agreement, provided that:<br/>
<br/>
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br/>
    b) its license agreement:<br/>
    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties<br/>
    and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or<br/>
    conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or<br/>
    conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br/>
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for<br/>
    damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and<br/>
    consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br/>
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are<br/>
    offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br/>
    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such<br/>
    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable<br/>
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br/>
<br/>
    When the Program is made available in source code form:<br/>
<br/>
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br/>
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br/>
    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained<br/>
    within the Program.<br/>
<br/>
    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,<br/>
    if<br/>
    any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the<br/>
    originator of the Contribution.<br/>
<br/>
    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br/>
<br/>
    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with<br/>
    respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is<br/>
    intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who<br/>
    includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner<br/>
    which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,<br/>
    if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such<br/>
    Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify<br/>
    every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,<br/>
    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and<br/>
    other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified<br/>
    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial<br/>
    Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial<br/>
    product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims<br/>
    or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property<br/>
    infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:<br/>
    a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and<br/>
    b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the<br/>
    Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement<br/>
    negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at<br/>
    its own expense.<br/>
<br/>
    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product<br/>
    offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If<br/>
    that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers<br/>
    warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are<br/>
    such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the<br/>
    Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other<br/>
    Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a<br/>
    court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the<br/>
    Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br/>
<br/>
    5. NO WARRANTY<br/>
<br/>
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN<br/>
    "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR<br/>
    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,<br/>
    NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each<br/>
    Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using<br/>
    and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its<br/>
    exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the<br/>
    risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to<br/>
    or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of<br/>
    operations.<br/>
<br/>
    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
<br/>
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY<br/>
    CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,<br/>
    SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION<br/>
    LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN<br/>
    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)<br/>
    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE<br/>
    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY<br/>
    OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
    7. GENERAL<br/>
<br/>
    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under<br/>
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the<br/>
    remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the<br/>
    parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent<br/>
    necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br/>
<br/>
    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself<br/>
    (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)<br/>
    infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted<br/>
    under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/>
<br/>
    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to<br/>
    comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does<br/>
    not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of<br/>
    such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,<br/>
    Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as<br/>
    reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement<br/>
    and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue<br/>
    and survive.<br/>
<br/>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in<br/>
    order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be<br/>
    modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to<br/>
    publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to<br/>
    time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this<br/>
    Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The<br/>
    Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement<br/>
    Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will<br/>
    be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including<br/>
    Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the<br/>
    Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the<br/>
    Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program<br/>
    (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly<br/>
    stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or<br/>
    licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,<br/>
    whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the<br/>
    Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br/>
<br/>
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the<br/>
    intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this<br/>
    Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year<br/>
    after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in<br/>
    any resulting litigation.
