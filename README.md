### WARNING FOR THIS BRANCH
It's a beta version. I wrote this with the thought that I'll need to write this again in mind.
Currently, I working in branch `redevelop`.
This version works, maybe even stable, but is really basic.

### Description
Program for universities, schools and beginner programmers.
Mainly it helps to understand the basics of programming.
It uses blocks with a code to visualise how the code is stored and executed.
This program is built to solve the problems of education of programmers.

### Features

- Visual blocks with code
- Different types of available blocks: conditional, executor, I/O, start, stop
- Statically typed
- Easy conversion between types
- Types based on Java
- Lot's of operators (all of existing in Java)
- Multidimensional arrays (only at branch `redevelop`)

### Future features
- More mathematical and text functions
- Clean code ;) Now I try to make it work... :)
